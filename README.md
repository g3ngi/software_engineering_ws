Welcome to our group's repository for the Software Engineering Workshop! In this project, we have developed a web application using Docker.

## Setup Docker

1. Download Docker Desktop from [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).
2. Install Docker Desktop by following the installation instructions for your operating system.

## Starting the Containerized Application

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where the application is located.
3. Run the following command to start the application:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```
4. Once the application is up and running, you can access it in your web browser at http://localhost:3000
